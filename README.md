Hello! And welcome to my task management website!

To begin, you'll need to run `bundle install` in your terminal.

Once you've done that, you'll need to run `shotgun` as well, in your terminal.

Now, you're ready to use the app! Open `http://localhost:9393/` in your browser of choice, I personally prefer Google Chrome. 

You'll see that you land on a welcome page that prompts you to either sign up, or login(if you've already signed up!). Click on one of the options, and fill out the form appropriately. Next, you'll be greeted on your very own page, cool! You'll see that at the top of the page, you have links that will help you GET THINGS DONE! The text on the page will also tell you that. 

`Create Task` will bring you to a page that has a form on it. Here, you'll type in your task, then press the button that says "Create Task." You'll then be brought to a page displaying the task you just created with a delete button. IMPORTANT: In your URL, you'll see a number. This number represents the unique ID for your task, you'll need to remember it(for now) to edit or delete your task, once you've left this page.

`All Tasks` will bring you to a page displaying all of your tasks.

To edit or delete a previous task you have made, you'll need to go to http://localhost:9393/tasks/#/edit, with # being replaced with the unique ID of your task, to edit, and http://localhost:9393/tasks/#, with # being replaced with the unique ID of your task, to delete. Pressing the delete button will do that for you, and bring you back to all of your tasks.

`Logout` is strtaightforward, and will log you out!

ENJOY!
